The SQL query best_hospitals.sql selects the 10 highest quality hospitals, as shown below:

hospital_name	total_score
FALLS COMMUNITY HOSPITAL AND CLINIC	235.5833333
BEAR VALLEY COMMUNITY HOSPITAL	175.3333333
HOSP COMUNITARIO BUEN SAMARITANO	167.25
MEDINA REGIONAL HOSPITAL	136
NEWARK BETH ISRAEL MEDICAL CENTER	134.8157895
REDWOOD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL	130.3333333
HOSPITAL HERMANOS MELENDEZ INC	130.2105263
MERCY HOSPITAL CASSVILLE	128
COMMUNITY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, INC	127.6666667
BOONE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL	125.3333333

This methodology is acceptable given the underlying data because the logic in our SQL query averages quality of care scores and these are the highest with a large sample size.
