Using the SQL code from our hospital_variability.sql script, we have the output below containing 10 procedures with the greatest variability between hospitals:

measure_name
Prophylactic Antibiotic Selection for Surgical Patients
Cardiac surgery patients with controlled 6 a.m. postoperative blood glucose
Evaluation of LVS Function
Fibrinolytic Therapy Received Within 30 Minutes Of Hospital Arrival
Initial antibiotic selection for CAP in immunocompetent patient
Postoperative Urinary Catheter Removal
Primary PCI Received Within 90 Minutes of Hospital Arrival
Prophylactic antibiotic received within 1 hour prior to surgical incision
Prophylactic antibiotics discontinued within 24 hours after surgery end time
Surgery Patients on a Beta Blocker Prior to Arrival Who Received a Beta Blocker During the Perioperative Period

This logic is solid because it effeciently measures procedural variability between hospitals.
